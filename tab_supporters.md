The OWASP SCSVS project was initiated to share the knowledge gained from the CredShields Security Team's research into Smart Contract security while developing [**SolidityScan.com**](https://solidityscan.com), an AI-powered vulnerability scanner for Smart Contracts. We extend our gratitude to [**CredShields**](https://credshields.com) for their efforts in defining the initial requirements and founding this project.
